# Budget Tracker

The Budget Tracker application is designed for travels. This application allows users to be able to track withdrawals and deposits both with and without data/internet connection. This allows users to always maintain an accurate account balance while traveling, since transactions will update even if the user tracks transactions offline.

The deployed application can be found here: https://ancient-atoll-58988.herokuapp.com/
